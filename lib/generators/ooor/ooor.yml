# As with config/secrets.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your Odoo portal password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your ERP with the portal user.
#
# Instead, provide the password as a unix environment variable when you boot
# the app. Read http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# for a full rundown on how to provide these environment variables in a
# production deployment.
#
# On Heroku and other platform providers, you may have a full connection URL
# available as an environment variable. For example:
#
#   OOOR_URL="ooor://myuser:mypass@localhost:port/somedatabase"
#
# You can use this database configuration with:
#
#   production:
#     url: <%%= ENV['OOOR_URL'] %>
#
production:
  <<: *default
  database: prod_db
  username: portal_user
  password: <%%= ENV['OOOR_PASSWORD'] %>
  url: https://prod_host
